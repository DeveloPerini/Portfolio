# My personal portfolio

### Introducing me!
Hello everyone! This is my personal portfolio where I talk about myself and my experience as a web development student,
and where I will show the whole world what I am capable of doing. I hope you like it and can take inspiration from it, I would be honored!

To create this portfolio, I did not use any frameworks or libraries.
